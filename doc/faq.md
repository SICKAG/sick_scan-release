:question: rviz shows a grey point cloud and the size of points can not be adjusted.

:white_check_mark: Probably in this case you are running Linux in a virtual machine. In this case, OpenGL may not work correctly in the VM. rviz then chooses a kind of "fallback solution" and deactivates the colors. 
Also, changing the "Size" and "Style" display in rviz has no effect on the display of the pointcloud data.

The problem can be avoided by starting rviz with the following sequence: 

```
export LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=1 
rosrun rviz rviz 
```
